SelectionSort

Increasing
1. Select the min, put it at the end.
2. How to find the min?
	1. Do a first pass and find the min, i.e. Left most element is minimum until a smaller is found. Once the entire traversal has happened, put the minimum in a auxiliary list. First pass Time = O(n), Space = O(n) + O(1)
3. What is the problem?
	1. Problem is the extra array that we are maintaining.
4. 

Insertion Sort
1. Make two sides, left and right
2. Left will be unsorted, Right will be sorted
3. We don't necessarily needs to have two arrays for left and right sides.
4. The inplace way of doing this is to have a left and side part in place.
5. Let the left part be sorted and is only 1 element long. 1 element long part will always be sorted.
6. We'll take one element from the right part and increase the sorted list.
7. We'll insert the element into the left part such as it is sorted.
